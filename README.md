### Dataset Description

This dataset is about past loans. The Loan_train.csv data set includes details of 346 customers whose loan are already paid off or defaulted. It includes fields as: Loan Status, Principal Loan Amount, Terms, Effective Date, Due Date, Age of applicant, Education of applicant and Gender of applicant.

There are two files, one for the train set and other for the test set. 

### Objectives

Build four models of Machine Learning aimed to classification problems that are able to make predictions about loan payments, these models are K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression.

Previous to the model, was needed a preprocessing of the data for the training set as the testing set. All the process is well described on the notebook. 

### Results and Conclusions

I reported the accuracy of the built model using different evaluation metrics like this:

The more accuracy model was the Support Vector Machine (SVM).
